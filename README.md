# CODTECH Internship - Task 1

## Task Title
API Integration and Data Visualization

## Description
This task demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap) using Python and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project fetches temperature and humidity data for a city and presents it in a clear and professional dashboard.

## Features
- Fetch weather forecast data for a city using OpenWeatherMap API
- Extract temperature and humidity information
- Visualize temperature and humidity in a combined dashboard
- Save the visualization as a PNG image

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python Libraries: `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn
How to Run

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in weather_dashboard.py with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

Run the Python script:

python weather_dashboard.py

The script will generate a visualization dashboard showing:

Temperature forecast

Humidity forecast

The dashboard will be saved as weather_dashboard.png.

Screenshot

This shows temperature (red line) and humidity (blue line) forecasts for the selected city.

Deliverables
